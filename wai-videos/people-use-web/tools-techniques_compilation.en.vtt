00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.000
This video from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.120
introduces some of the tools and techniques that people with disabilities use to interact with the web. 

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.040
Some use specialized software or hardware, called assistive technology.

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.000
Others adapt standard software or hardware to better meet their needs.

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.880
Perception - hearing, feeling and seeing.

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.320
When content is accessible,

7
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.360
people can perceive it through different senses,

8
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.800
depending on their needs and preferences.

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.760
For example,

10
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.360
some people who can't see a screen

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.400
or hear audio,

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.920
rely on websites and apps

13
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.120
that can present the information

14
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.600
in different ways.

15
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.960
People who are blind may

16
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.240
use assistive technology

17
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.000
on computers and mobile phones

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.680
called screen readers.

19
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.000
These software tools

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.320
read the information on the screen out loud,

21
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.560
or they can present it in braille.

22
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.400
Bird.

23
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.560
Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates

24
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.720
constituting the class Aves,

25
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.400
(/’eIvi:z/)

26
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.840
characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of

27
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.240
Screen readers process websites and apps

28
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.920
with correctly coded headings,

29
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.400
lists, links, buttons, and other structures much better.

30
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.840
People who are blind rely on hearing or touch,

31
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.440
rather than sight.

32
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.280
For video,

33
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.720
content creators need to ensure

34
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.360
that visual information is provided

35
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.720
in auditory form as well.

36
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.560
Often these descriptions

37
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.040
of visual information can be placed

38
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.080
in existing pauses in the audio,

39
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.440
or the script can be created

40
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.280
from the start with sufficient description

41
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.040
of the scenes, characters,

42
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.120
and other important visual information.

43
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.280
People who are deaf-blind

44
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.080
also use screen readers to present the information

45
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.440
using a device called a

46
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.800
Refreshable Braille display.

47
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.520
Braille characters are a combination

48
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.040
of raised or lowered dots,

49
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.880
which people read by scanning over them

50
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.520
with their fingertips.

51
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.320
Similarly to people who are blind and deaf-blind,

52
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.640
people who are Deaf or hard of hearing

53
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.920
may use haptic feedback too;

54
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.600
for example, through vibration alerts on a mobile phone

55
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.640
instead of auditory notifications.

56
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.200
People who are Deaf or hard of hearing

57
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.920
often rely on seeing instead of hearing.

58
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.760
For example, while watching a video

59
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.000
they may use captions or sign language

60
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.240
as an alternative to the audio.

61
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.160
You can help

62
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.000
make technology

63
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.000
accessible

64
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.280
to me.

65
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.080
Accessibility: It's about people. 

66
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.480
Presentation: distinguishing

67
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.200
and understanding.

68
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.120
When content is accessible,

69
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.760
people can adjust its presentation to make it easier

70
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.560
to distinguish and understand.

71
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.000
This could include adjusting

72
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.200
screen size and color

73
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.320
to see better,

74
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.600
adjusting audio volume

75
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.400
to hear better, or adjusting

76
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.480
how text is presented to read it better.

77
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.520
Some people with low vision

78
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.600
increased the text size

79
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.360
to make it easier to read.

80
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.560
They might adjust properties

81
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.760
in the web browser or operating system,

82
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.720
such as increasing

83
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.960
the default text size,

84
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.080
font type, and line

85
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.080
spacing to better see the text.

86
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.520
Websites and apps that are programmed

87
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.520
and designed to adapt to these properties,

88
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.280
allow people to use the content

89
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.880
without the text overlapping,

90
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.960
getting cropped,

91
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.320
or requiring them to scroll

92
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.040
both vertically and horizontally.

93
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.920
Other people with low vision

94
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.560
increase everything on the screen,

95
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.120
not only text.

96
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.480
They might use screen magnification software

97
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.640
as a digital magnifying glass.

98
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.440
Some might also change the text

99
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.440
and background colors

100
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.920
to better read the text

101
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.200
and text-to-speech

102
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.000
to hear the text while they're reading.

103
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.520
This means that websites and apps

104
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.080
need to be programmed and designed

105
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.240
to allow people to change the colors

106
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.400
rather than forcing them

107
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.560
to appear in a certain way.

108
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.040
Presentation is not only visual.

109
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.600
People with auditory disabilities, for example,

110
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600
might need to increase

111
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.120
the volume of online meetings

112
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.880
and multimedia like videos,

113
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.360
podcasts and music,

114
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.160
without increasing the volume of other

115
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.080
system sounds like notification alerts.

116
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.280
Adjusting the bass,

117
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.000
treble and balance of the sound

118
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
can make the audio easier to hear,

119
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.320
so operating systems and media players

120
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.080
need to provide these settings.

121
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.520
Also, these settings work

122
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.040
better with high quality audio

123
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.080
that does not have background noise.

124
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.760
Presentation adjustments

125
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.240
can also make content easier

126
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.400
to focus on,

127
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.440
particularly for people

128
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.000
with different types of cognitive

129
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.600
and learning disabilities.

130
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.160
This includes “reading modes”

131
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.440
that hide less relevant parts of the content,

132
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.600
such as sidebars and front matter;

133
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.040
pop up and animation blockers

134
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.320
that help avoid distraction

135
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.440
and interruption;

136
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.040
and digital reading rules

137
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.840
that help readers

138
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.320
focus on one line at a time.

139
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.920
Some reading assistants,

140
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.960
for example, those that 

141
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.880
some people with dyslexia might use

142
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.520
adjust how the text is presented

143
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.480
to make it easier to read.

144
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.200
This includes changing the font type,

145
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.000
text size, colors

146
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.720
and the spacing between letters,

147
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.760
sentences and paragraphs.

148
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.240
Some people read better with serif-type fonts

149
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.280
and others with sensory fonts.

150
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.360
Adjusting these properties are individual

151
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.920
from one person to another,

152
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.000
which is why flexible

153
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.160
design is so important.

154
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.800
Other reading assistants

155
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.360
support comprehension.

156
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.720
Some can process a text

157
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.600
to simplify words and phrases,

158
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.240
and sometimes also simplify

159
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.920
complex sentences.

160
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.280
These tools rely on proper

161
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.280
programming and design to work.

162
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.720
You can help make technology accessible to me.

163
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.320
Accessibility: It’s about people.

164
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.800
Input - Typing, Writing and Clicking

165
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.160
When content is accessible, people can 
use a variety of hardware and software

166
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.400
to enter text and activate commands.

167
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.720
Some people do not use keyboards

168
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.040
and use only pointing devices instead.

169
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.280
This could include a specialised mouse,

170
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.880
joystick, trackball,

171
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.440
or touch screen to click links and buttons
and to type on on-screen keyboards.

172
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.520
However, even when using these tools,

173
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.920
people might have difficulty

174
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.480
selecting small targets,

175
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.280
such as small links, buttons and controls.

176
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.240
Websites and apps with large
clickable areas around checkboxes,

177
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.520
radio buttons, and other controls,

178
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.040
are easier to use for people

179
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.320
with limited mobility

180
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.800
and reduced dexterity.

181
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.600
Websites and apps also
need to provide support

182
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.560
for people who use the keyboard only.

183
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.280
This includes providing ways
to skip over repeated content,

184
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.720
such as headers and navigation bars, 
as well as not breaking the default

185
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.880
functionality in browsers
and operating systems.

186
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.960
For example,

187
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.800
using the Tab key to move around

188
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.440
clickable items in the content,

189
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.720
using the Enter key for selecting items,

190
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.160
and making the currently active item visible

191
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.520
by showing a rectangular box around it.

192
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.880
Websites and apps that provide
word prediction and accelerators,

193
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.640
for example for search terms,

194
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.320
reduce the amount of typing,

195
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.720
and make them more efficient

196
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.000
for keyboard users.

197
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.080
Additionally, not everyone using
only the keyboard can see the screen;

198
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.600
for example, people who are blind.

199
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.600
So, in addition to
ensuring keyboard support,

200
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.840
websites and apps also need
to provide clear instructions, 

201
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.160
labels for form controls, error
messages, and status notifications,

202
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.840
so that people know what
is happening on the screen.

203
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.200
Websites and apps need to help people
find and correct mistakes in their input;

204
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.000
for example, by showing a summary
of the entered data before submitting it.

205
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.440
They also need to provide sufficient
time to complete tasks,

206
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.960
or avoid timing limitations altogether.

207
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.480
Many people with disabilities
require more time to navigate

208
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.560
and orient themselves in the
content, and to click and type.

209
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.200
In particular, people with cognitive
and learning disabilities.

210
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.400
Finally, websites and apps also need
to consider people who do not use

211
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.800
keyboard or pointing devices at all,
and use speech input instead.

212
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.400
For example, websites and apps
need to be programmed and designed

213
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.760
so that the name of a button

214
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.920
in the software code matches
the name displayed to the user.

215
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.960
Click send email.

216
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.480
You can help make technology
accessible to me.

217
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.960
Accessibility: it's about people.

218
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.600
Interaction - navigation and finding

219
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.400
When content is accessible,

220
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.480
people can navigate and find information

221
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.760
using different strategies and approaches

222
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.280
depending on their preferences,

223
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.160
skills and abilities.

224
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.920
Many people with cognitive

225
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.280
and learning disabilities

226
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.160
rely on clear layout and design

227
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.280
to find information on websites and apps.

228
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.400
This includes different ways

229
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.960
of navigating the content,

230
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.840
such as using hierarchical menus

231
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.760
as well as search functionality;

232
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.280
with visual orientation cues,

233
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.840
such as using background colors

234
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.080
to indicate different parts

235
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.120
of the content,

236
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.640
using unique headings,

237
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.080
and placing relevant information

238
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.960
in prominent areas.

239
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.360
It's also important to use

240
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.600
a consistent and predictable design.

241
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.880
While many of these are typically usability

242
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.600
aspects that affect people with

243
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.240
and without disabilities,

244
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.480
these situations often

245
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.680
affect people with disabilities to a greater extent.

246
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.560
For example,

247
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.560
people with low vision

248
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.160
who use screen magnification

249
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.800
also rely on visual orientation cues

250
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.120
to orient themselves and find information

251
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.520
on websites and apps.

252
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.560
And consistency predictability helps everyone.

253
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.240
For example,

254
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.080
people who are blind use screen readers

255
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.800
to scan the content structures,

256
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.880
such as headings,

257
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.760
links, and navigational menus

258
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.360
to get an overview and orient themselves.

259
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.920
Websites and apps with clear

260
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.280
and consistent headings,

261
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.040
labels and structures

262
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.800
make the content

263
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.200
more predictable and easier to navigate.

264
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.040
In addition,

265
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.040
people who are blind rely on mechanisms

266
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.960
to skip over blocks of content,

267
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.040
such as headings,

268
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.080
navigation bars,

269
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.000
or menus,

270
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.520
repeated within websites and apps.

271
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.840
They also rely on websites and apps to provide

272
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.040
clear instructions

273
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.520
and help users identify

274
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.840
and correct mistakes,

275
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.200
such as incorrect dates,

276
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.360
numbers and other input.

277
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.400
In addition,

278
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.040
people with physical disabilities

279
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.440
rely on consistent labels which allow browsers

280
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.320
to optionally remember previous entries.

281
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.640
This speeds up typing

282
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.800
because people can select previous entries,

283
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.480
for example, names and addresses.

284
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.920
You can help make technology
accessible to me.

285
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.000
Accessibility: it's about people.
