How People with Disabilities use Digital Technology.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.960
Marta,

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.120
a marketing assistant

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.360
who is Deaf and blind.

5
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.600
Hi!

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.640
I'm Marta,

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.440
a marketing assistant at my school for the Deaf.

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.640
I'm Deaf-blind.

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.880
I was born Deaf

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.720
and have progressive vision loss,

11
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.080
which means I can still see things

12
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.360
if they're large and up-close

13
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.960
but I see less and less each year.

14
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.120
As a Deaf child,

15
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.320
I learned sign language early on.

16
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.280
This is why technology

17
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.680
is so important to me-

18
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.600
it allows me to communicate with more people.

19
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.880
At home,

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.960
I have a computer

21
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.400
that can enlarge my documents up to 20 times.

22
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.680
I have a big screen

23
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.760
but can still only see a very small portion of the screen,

24
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.160
and an even smaller portion of the documents

25
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.440
because it's like looking through a magnification lens.

26
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.080
I can find my way around documents

27
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.680
with headings and sections that look different.

28
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.800
For example, this briefing sheet uses

29
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.760
a color for the headings

30
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760
that is different from the main content,

31
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.080
which makes it easier for me to recognize them.

32
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.760
Oh, and I'm learning to use braille too.

33
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.240
Braille are those dots that you read

34
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.200
with your fingers,

35
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.760
and I have this really cool device

36
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.840
called a “refreshable braille display” -

37
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.040
it's a small device

38
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.560
that I can take with me everywhere,

39
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.360
unlike my computer.

40
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.960
It has apps for email, web and chat,

41
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.520
and some have a special keyboard

42
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.240
for typing in braille.

43
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.560
I read the braille characters

44
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.640
in a row on the device,

45
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.800
which I'm slowly getting used to.

46
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.680
It's always difficult to learn to use something new at first

47
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
but I'm getting better at reading and typing braille.

48
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.760
But not all websites and apps work well with magnification

49
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.640
or on my braille display.

50
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.880
Like when I need to look up the bus schedule

51
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.560
to meet up with my friends -

52
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.840
that table doesn't work well when I enlarge it on my phone.

53
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.200
And forget about trying to read it in braille.

54
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.280
I can't tell what row or column I'm in

55
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.320
and it just jumps all over the place!

56
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.560
It makes me nervous

57
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.440
because I can't as easily ask for help

58
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.480
from people around me while I'm out,

59
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.160
so I've been learning how to speak up

60
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.240
and ask companies for more accessible websites and apps

61
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.040
 to help me stay independent.

62
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.960
You can help

63
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.800
make technology

64
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.800
accessible

65
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.080
to me.

66
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.880
Accessibility: It's about people. 

67
