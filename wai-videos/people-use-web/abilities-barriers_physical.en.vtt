How People With Disabilities
Use Digital Technology

Physical Disabilities

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.080
Physical disabilities affect how people move,

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.760
including an inability to move,

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.520
limited mobility,

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.080
a lack of coordination,

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.120
tremors and involuntary movement,

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.120
pain that impedes movement,

9
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.120
as well as missing and non-typical limbs.

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.720
People who use a mouse might
have difficulty with fine motor control.

11
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.920
For example, tremors, non-typical joints,
pain, or fatigue can prevent people

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.240
from being able to select small targets,
such as small links, buttons and controls.

13
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.920
Websites and apps with large clickable
areas around checkboxes, radio buttons,

14
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.560
and other controls, are easier to use
for people with limited mobility

15
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.200
and reduced dexterity.

16
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.280
Other people use speech input instead.

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.160
While speech input uses the
keyboard interface in the background,

18
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.360
websites and apps that are programmed and
designed with consideration for speech input

19
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.720
are more effective.

20
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.640
For example, when the name of a button in
the code matches the name displayed visually,

21
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.480
people using speech input
know what they need to say

22
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.600
to click that button.

23
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.520
Click send email.

24
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.000
Some people do not use a mouse,
touch screen, or other pointing devices.

25
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.080
They might use specialised
keyboards with larger keys,

26
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.880
or more space between the keys.

27
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.200
Some use tools such as a 
mouthstick or headstick to type.

28
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.520
Websites and apps that make functions

29
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.600
visibly clear with active focus styles

30
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.560
and usable with keyboard only

31
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.680
are easier to use for

32
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.400
people with physical disabilities.

33
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.920
Regardless of the input device used,

34
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.760
websites and apps that provide sufficient
time to type and to complete tasks

35
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.520
are easier to use for people
with physical disabilities

36
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.120
because it might take people longer
to navigate and type,

37
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.200
and to correct typing mistakes.

38
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.280
Providing clear headings and instructions

39
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.280
helps people to understand the tasks

40
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280
and reduces the time
needed to complete them.

41
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.520
This includes instructions for
forms and functionality,

42
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.480
as well as error messages and dialogues.

43
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520
Finally, websites and apps that work in

44
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.840
both portrait and landscape orientation

45
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.280
are easier to use for people

46
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.920
who have their devices mounted to their

47
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.000
wheelchair, desk, or bed.

48
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.240
You can help make technology
accessible to me.

49
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.640
Accessibility: it's about people.

50
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.440
