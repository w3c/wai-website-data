Lexie, online shopper who cannot distinguish between colors 
(color blindness).

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.720
Hello! I’m Lexie.

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.880
I was born with deuteranopia and protanopia,

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.120
which people often call “color blindness”.

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.080
I have difficulty distinguishing between

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.680
red, green, orange, and brown,

8
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.960
all of which appear to me as kind of murky brown.

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.880
In a store, I often can’t tell the color of

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.280
two shoes or two shirts beside each other.

11
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.720
I love online shopping

12
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.400
because it’s often easier for me

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.440
when they use the names of the colors

14
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.280
in addition to showing the colors.

15
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.960
Unfortunately,

16
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.240
not all online shops have an accessible checkout experience for me.

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.200
Often the sign-up or checkout form says “fields in red are required”.

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.960
Most times I can’t tell which fields are required

19
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.120
when they use color only.

20
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.760
Good shops either have the word “required”

21
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.080
or that little star beside the fields,

22
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.560
or even better put the word “optional” beside the ones I can skip.

23
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.400
Not relying on color alone is important for other websites

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.800
and apps too!

25
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.200
For example, my favorite fantasy football app

26
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.640
has a symbol for each team

27
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.560
on the jersey of the players, in addition to color.

28
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.360
This helps me spot the players on my team more quickly,

29
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.760
not just by reading the names under each player.

30
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.160
Color issues also happen at work.

31
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.600
For example, when my colleagues highlight words in a document

32
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.840
without using the commenting function.

33
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.240
The commenting function outlines the marked text

34
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.720
in addition to highlighting it.

35
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.920
Another example is when charts don’t have symbols

36
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.520
as well as the colors for lines and bars.

37
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.800
I can’t identify them from color alone.

38
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.640
My team is usually careful about this

39
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.680
but sometimes the suppliers we work with aren’t.

40
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.080
You can help make technology accessible to me.

41
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.760
Accessibility: It’s about people.

42
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.600
