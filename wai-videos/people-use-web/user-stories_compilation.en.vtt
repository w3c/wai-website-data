00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.920
In this video from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.360
we hear from nine people with different disabilities -

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.440
how they use digital technology,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.000
the barriers they face with bad designs,

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.760
and how technology works well

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.040
when it is accessible.

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.280
Ade - reporter with limited use of his arms.

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.520
Hello! I’m Ade,

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.200
I’m quadriplegic, which means I have limited movement

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.440
in my arms as well as my legs.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.440
The technology I use is really important to me.

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.920
I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts,

13
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.520
especially for the programs that I use often.

14
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.520
For example, scrolling a page is much easier with the arrow keys on

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.080
the keyboard than by clicking on that button in the scroll bar.

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.440
Unfortunately, many websites and apps

17
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.000
don’t work well with my keyboard.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.680
Often what has focus is not clear

19
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.760
or it jumps around completely out of order.

20
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.120
Sometimes that doesn’t work well because some websites

21
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.120
and apps don’t work in landscape orientation,

22
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.440
which is how I setup my tablet so that the

23
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.120
buttons are big enough for me to click.

24
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.920
While I can use a keyboard and joystick,

25
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
I can’t use them for long periods because it’s tiring.

26
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.480
So, I recently started using speech control software as well.

27
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.640
It allows me to dictate text instead of typing,

28
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.440
and to say certain commands instead of clicking.

29
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.880
It’s really hard to learn a new way of working after so many years

30
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.960
but I’ve been patient with it and I’m slowly getting used to it.

31
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.960
The most difficult thing is buttons without labels.

32
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.480
It is not clear which voice commands will activate them.

33
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.520
You can help make technology accessible to me.

34
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.400
Accessibility: It’s about people.

35
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.440
Ian - data scientist with autism.

36
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.800
Hello! I’m Ian.

37
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.040
I’m autistic.

38
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.280
I work for a software company three bus stops from my home.

39
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.080
I’m a data scientist. I enjoy my work very much. 

40
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.440
Others find this work difficult because it’s quite technical

41
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.560
but for me, it’s really easy.

42
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.000
Except when something changes

43
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.240
and I don’t have enough time to figure out what changed.

44
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.480
Like, when I was trying to get to an online meeting

45
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.080
and found that the buttons on the app changed.

46
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.280
It was very stressful because

47
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.760
I was worried about being late to the meeting.

48
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.920
Apps that ask for permission before updating

49
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.640
allow me to find a suitable time and adjust to the changes.

50
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.080
Sometimes I press the wrong thing and everything just changes

51
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.520
and I don’t know how to go back. 

52
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.120
It makes me feel like I just can’t cope.

53
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.320
I am trying to work, but I just can’t and I start to panic,

54
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.080
and then I can’t even talk anymore.

55
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.840
It’s very important to me when I can roll back and undo changes

56
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.280
that I didn’t intend or expect to happen.

57
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.200
It’s also really frustrating when I have to stop work

58
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.640
because of an error message that doesn’t tell me what the error is.

59
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.720
Error messages that just say “input error” are so useless.

60
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.120
Often it’s something really simple,

61
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.080
like I didn’t use the right format for the date.

62
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.000
Why doesn’t it say that?

63
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.640
I love to cook when I’m not working.

64
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.000
My friends love to eat what I cook because I find the best recipes!

65
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.960
Some cooking websites and apps are easy to use.

66
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.040
My favorite recipe sites list the exact ingredients

67
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.520
and have step-by-step instructions.

68
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.080
It’s easy to find the recipes using the tags and to follow them.

69
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.760
Unfortunately, I can’t use some recipe sites

70
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.760
even though they have recipes I really want to try.

71
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.520
Especially the ones where all sorts of videos start playing

72
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.480
and pop-up windows appear without me pressing anything.

73
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.480
I didn’t ask for this!

74
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.080
These are overwhelming and aren’t the recipe.

75
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.080
All I want is the recipe!

76
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.320
Or some sites use meaningless words and phrases

77
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.360
and don’t even bother explaining them.

78
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.360
I mean - what is a scant cup of brown sugar?

79
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.160
”Scant” could mean so many different things.

80
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.880
Instead of “scant” just say what you mean.

81
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.280
Like a cooking cup filled just below the top

82
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.000
or not quite a full cup.

83
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.560
That would be easier to understand for everyone.

84
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.840
You can help make technology accessible to me.

85
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.720
Accessibility: It’s about people.

86
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.640
Lexie, online shopper who cannot distinguish between colors 
(color blindness).

87
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.080
Hello! I’m Lexie.

88
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.240
I was born with deuteranopia and protanopia,

89
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.480
which people often call “color blindness”.

90
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.440
I have difficulty distinguishing between

91
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.040
red, green, orange, and brown,

92
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.320
all of which appear to me as kind of murky brown.

93
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.240
In a store, I often can’t tell the color of

94
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.640
two shoes or two shirts beside each other.

95
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.080
I love online shopping

96
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.760
because it’s often easier for me

97
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.800
when they use the names of the colors

98
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.640
in addition to showing the colors.

99
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.320
Unfortunately,

100
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.600
not all online shops have an accessible checkout experience for me.

101
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.560
Often the sign-up or checkout form says “fields in red are required”.

102
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.320
Most times I can’t tell which fields are required

103
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.480
when they use color only.

104
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.120
Good shops either have the word “required”

105
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.440
or that little star beside the fields,

106
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.920
or even better put the word “optional” beside the ones I can skip.

107
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.760
Not relying on color alone is important for other websites

108
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.160
and apps too!

109
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.560
For example, my favorite fantasy football app

110
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.000
has a symbol for each team

111
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.920
on the jersey of the players, in addition to color.

112
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.720
This helps me spot the players on my team more quickly,

113
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.120
not just by reading the names under each player.

114
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.520
Color issues also happen at work.

115
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.960
For example, when my colleagues highlight words in a document

116
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.200
without using the commenting function.

117
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.600
The commenting function outlines the marked text

118
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.080
in addition to highlighting it.

119
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.280
Another example is when charts don’t have symbols

120
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.880
as well as the colors for lines and bars.

121
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.160
I can’t identify them from color alone.

122
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.000
My team is usually careful about this

123
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.040
but sometimes the suppliers we work with aren’t.

124
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.440
You can help make technology accessible to me.

125
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.440
Accessibility: It’s about people.

126
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.920
Sophie - basketball fan with Down syndrome.

127
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.000
Hello, I'm Sophie.

128
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.800
I have Down syndrome.

129
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.240
I love basketball!

130
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.000
And I played on my school team,

131
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.720
and now I work in a stadium.

132
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.200
At work, we use an app for our team.

133
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.160
It has a calendar

134
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.840
with all our practices and games.

135
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.400
My job is to record scores and stuff like that.

136
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.920
I can also use it to chat with the coach

137
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.640
and with the players,

138
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.880
and we use it to exchange photos and jokes too.

139
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.560
[chuckles]

140
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.520
Sometimes, I take longer to read things

141
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.600
but this app is really easy to use.

142
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600
The event or name of the player is at the top,

143
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.240
so I know where I am in the app.

144
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.240
The calendar is also very clear.

145
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.960
It shows the name of the month

146
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.800
or the number of the week at the top too.

147
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.600
Other apps we tried are too confusing -

148
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.240
I could never tell where I am and how to get back.

149
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.600
The biggest problem is buying tickets for games.

150
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.800
I try to use this app for buying

151
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.120
but sometimes

152
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.960
I have to use other apps to get tickets.

153
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.520
Some of these apps are too hard.

154
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.920
When I click on something

155
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.200
it goes somewhere else

156
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.120
or opens another page.

157
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.280
Or, it doesn't have that blue box at the top

158
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.160
so I don't know where I am

159
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.320
and how to get back.

160
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.440
Sometimes it takes too long,

161
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.280
I have to start all over again.

162
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.480
It's a real pain.

163
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.960
I wish buying tickets could be easier.

164
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.160
My dream is to become a senior assistant.

165
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.160
I know I can do it.

166
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.160
Sometimes it's hard

167
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.600
for me to write long things,

168
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.360
but I use the spell-checker every time.

169
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.680
It helps me when coaches use

170
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.600
words I already know.

171
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.320
Otherwise, it takes me even

172
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.400
longer to find the words

173
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.480
in the dictionary.

174
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.080
You can help make technology accessible to me.

175
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.680
Accessibility: It’s about people.

176
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.440
Dhruv - older adult student who is deaf.

177
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:59.800
Hello! My name is D-H-R-U-V, Dhruv. I’m Deaf.

178
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:08.920
I can hear some sounds but not enough to understand speech.

179
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:19.240
I sign British Sign Language. I think and dream in signs.

180
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.360
I recently enrolled in an online degree.

181
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.360
For my classes I schedule can interpreters who interpret 

182
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.960
the lectures and conversations, and voice for me.

183
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.960
I need video conferencing apps with functionality to “pin” videos

184
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.360
of the interpreters so that I can always see them.

185
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.640
Some lectures have realtime captioning typed by human captioners.

186
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.520
This is more accurate than automatic captions, which often

187
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.320
don’t recognize specialized terms in the lectures.

188
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.720
For our assigned videos, I rely on good captions.

189
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.920
These are edited so that each sentence appearing on the screen

190
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.880
is not too long and is synchronized with the audio.

191
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.720
I also often find myself needing to adjust the text size and colors of

192
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.240
the captions, to be able to read them better. Some apps also allow

193
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.400
me to move the captions to the top or bottom of the video,

194
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.760
so that they are not in the way.

195
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.400
In some situations, I find myself lip reading.

196
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.280
For example, when I’m on unplanned calls without interpreters

197
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.440
or other people who can sign.

198
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.160
I learned lip reading over the years because of such 

199
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.600
situations but it’s not always reliable for me.

200
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.720
I need to see the person’s mouth, have them speak clearly,

201
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.160
and seeing their gestures also helps. Yet it’s exhausting

202
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.560
and not really something I can keep doing for too long.

203
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.800
I also use the chat function.

204
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.080
Some chat tools support realtime text

205
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.520
rather than line-by-line text messages.

206
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.760
This is much more interactive, and I can engage with my friends in

207
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.040
 text conversations as others do by voice.

208
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.680
Of course, the classes also come with a lot of reading.

209
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.440
I’m fine with that, except when the writing is unnecessarily

210
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.960
complex and without structure like lists and headings.

211
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.120
People don’t realize that for me reading text involves extra effort,

212
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.080
because sign language is my native language.

213
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.720
So, like for everyone else, clear and simple writing makes

214
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.960
text easier to understand.

215
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:27.280
You can help make technology accessible to me.

216
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.160
Accessibility: It’s about people.

217
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.520
Marta - a marketing assistant who is Deaf and blind.

218
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.280
Hi!

219
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.320
I'm Marta,

220
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:55.120
a marketing assistant at my school for the Deaf.

221
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.320
I'm Deaf-blind.

222
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.560
I was born Deaf

223
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.400
and have progressive vision loss,

224
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.760
which means I can still see things

225
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.040
if they're large and up-close

226
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:25.640
but I see less and less each year.

227
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.800
As a Deaf child,

228
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.000
I learned sign language early on.

229
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.960
This is why technology

230
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.360
is so important to me-

231
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.280
it allows me to communicate with more people.

232
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.560
At home,

233
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.640
I have a computer

234
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.080
that can enlarge my documents up to 20 times.

235
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.360
I have a big screen

236
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.440
but can still only see a very small portion of the screen,

237
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.840
and an even smaller portion of the documents

238
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.120
because it's like looking through a magnification lens.

239
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.760
I can find my way around documents

240
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.360
with headings and sections that look different.

241
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.480
For example, this briefing sheet uses

242
00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.440
a color for the headings

243
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.440
that is different from the main content,

244
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.760
which makes it easier for me to recognize them.

245
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.440
Oh, and I'm learning to use braille too.

246
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.920
Braille are those dots that you read

247
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.880
with your fingers,

248
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.440
and I have this really cool device

249
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.520
called a “refreshable braille display” -

250
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.720
it's a small device

251
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.240
that I can take with me everywhere,

252
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.040
unlike my computer.

253
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.640
It has apps for email, web and chat,

254
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.200
and some have a special keyboard

255
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.920
for typing in braille.

256
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.240
I read the braille characters

257
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.320
in a row on the device,

258
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.480
which I'm slowly getting used to.

259
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.360
It's always difficult to learn to use something new at first

260
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.360
but I'm getting better at reading and typing braille.

261
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.440
But not all websites and apps work well with magnification

262
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.320
or on my braille display.

263
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.560
Like when I need to look up the bus schedule

264
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.240
to meet up with my friends -

265
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.520
that table doesn't work well when I enlarge it on my phone.

266
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.880
And forget about trying to read it in braille.

267
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.960
I can't tell what row or column I'm in

268
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.000
and it just jumps all over the place!

269
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.240
It makes me nervous

270
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.120
because I can't as easily ask for help

271
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.160
from people around me while I'm out,

272
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.840
so I've been learning how to speak up

273
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.920
and ask companies for more accessible websites and apps

274
00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.720
 to help me stay independent.

275
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.640
You can help

276
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.480
make technology

277
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.480
accessible

278
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.760
to me.

279
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.560
Accessibility: It's about people. 

280
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:30.240
Stefan - Student with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia.

281
00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.480
Hello, I'm Stefan.

282
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.840
I have dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

283
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.520
ADHD.

284
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.440
I have difficulty recognizing
or sounding out written words,

285
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.280
even though I use those same words
in conversation all the time.

286
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.920
It affects my spelling
and my reading comprehension.

287
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.200
It often takes me a long time to figure
out the individual words I'm reading,

288
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.640
and then it's hard for me to remember 

289
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.000
how the words in a sentence
fit together in a meaningful way.

290
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.960
Digital books and documents
are often much better for me.

291
00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.120
On the computer, on a tablet,
or - my favorite - on my new e-reader.

292
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.200
I can change the font type,
text size and line spacing,

293
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.800
which makes it easier for me to read.

294
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.240
I also use the read aloud function
because I read better

295
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.160
when I can see
and hear the text at the same time.

296
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.720
It also
highlights the words being read aloud

297
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.800
and has a reading ruler,
so that I can follow along more easily.

298
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.040
Sometimes, though, digital books and
documents don't work well.

299
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.600
Sometimes they are just scanned images.

300
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.400
These also can't be read aloud
and I can't change the text size and font.

301
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.120
Some don't have bookmarks, which I use
to jump to the parts I want to focus on.

302
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.040
Or, there are long chunks of text
without any headings,

303
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.160
so I have difficulty
focusing on the content.

304
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.280
It's so much easier
when text has more spacing

305
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.640
and graphics
to make them easier to follow.

306
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.120
Another problem is when I have to do
online research,

307
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.280
I type in words, but sometimes
I do it wrong or use a different word

308
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.640
that sounds the same, like “brake”
when I mean “break”.

309
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.880
Sometimes I land on websites
with all these ads and things

310
00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.040
popping up and moving around the screen.

311
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.400
With ADHD, I get distracted
by these ads and videos,

312
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.520
and sometimes I click on them
and I forget what I was meant to be doing.

313
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.200
I use several pop-up blockers,
but they don't always work.

314
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.480
When I find an article I want to read,

315
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.560
I try to remember to switch
to reading mode in my browser.

316
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.520
This usually removes all the stuff around
the page and lets me focus on the text.

317
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.000
But some websites don't work
well and the ads still appear,

318
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.280
or the text is too difficult
for me to read.

319
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.360
I love it when websites work well
with my settings and extensions.

320
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.080
Like, the extension
for spelling and grammar,

321
00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.080
which helps me when I'm typing
things like emails.

322
00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.480
That's very important for me.

323
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.520
You can help make
technology accessible to me.

324
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.080
Accessibility: It’s about people.

325
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.960
Elias - retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss. 

326
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.000
Hello! I’m Elias.

327
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.800
I’m a retired architect.

328
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.840
Life moves slower now that I’m retired,

329
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.280
and I think my body does too [laughs]!

330
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.200
I see less

331
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.360
and hear less than in my younger days.

332
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.800
Also, my hands shake a little.

333
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.160
My children live far away,
so we see each other online instead.

334
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.080
We also write to each other
and send pictures.

335
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.360
It’s so much easier and quicker
than going to the post office

336
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.800
every time

337
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.840
[chuckles].

338
00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.440
My trouble is all this small text!
Why do they write so small?

339
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.800
I know how to make the text size bigger
but it doesn’t work with all websites.

340
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.480
Sometimes everything seems to break down
– the text

341
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.880
overlaps or goes somewhere else
or disappears completely.

342
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:19.560
Or, I have to scroll sideways to read –
I don’t have the time and energy for that.

343
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:26.680
It’s the same with apps.
I made the text bigger on my mobile phone.

344
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.440
I can’t see without doing that
on such a small screen.

345
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.520
Most apps work
well but not the banking app.

346
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:36.520
The text on that app is still small,

347
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.560
and I need to use it
to log into my bank account.

348
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.080
I already called them

349
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.360
several times about this
but nothing happens.

350
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.120
It’s not only reading, though.

351
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.960
When the text is small,
all the buttons and links are also small.

352
00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.880
Sometimes tiny. Especially on forms,

353
00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.600
where you have to click and select
all these things -

354
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.080
it’s hard with my hands,

355
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.760
they don’t behave like they used to.

356
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.200
Our grocery store
now has an online shop, which is fantastic

357
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.320
because I don’t have to carry
all the shopping any more.

358
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.040
The text is big
and it has big links and buttons.

359
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.240
It just seems clearer
and easier to find things – 

360
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.200
everything is where it should be on
every page.

361
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.960
Usually,
I have trouble remembering things,

362
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.160
like the telephone number,
address, and credit card details.

363
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.920
This store remembers from before,
so I only need to select the right address

364
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.760
in the text field
rather than needing to type it each time.

365
00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.800
I wish all websites could be that easy.

366
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.640
You can help make technology
accessible to me.

367
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.480
Accessibility: It's about people.

368
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.600
