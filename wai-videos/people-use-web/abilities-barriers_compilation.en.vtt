00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.160
This video from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.920
introduces the wide diversity of people and abilities.

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.720
It shows some of the barriers faced by people with disabilities when using digital technology.

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.000
Auditory Disabilities.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.040
Auditory disabilities affect how people
hear, including hearing less in one

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.320
Auditory Disabilities.

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.480
or both ears,
not hearing, and hearing sounds

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.600
in a range of different ways.

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.320
High-quality sound is important
for many people with reduced hearing.

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.800
Audio needs to be clear and background
noise low

11
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.120
to make speech easier to understand.

12
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.640
Websites and apps that allow users
to adjust the volume of the audio

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.880
that it is currently playing

14
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.960
without changing the volume for other
sounds from the computer, such

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.920
as notifications, make it easier
for people to hear the audio.

16
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.920
Some people with auditory disabilities
use hearing devices but this does

17
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.400
not always mean they can hear all audio,
or hear it clearly.

18
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.600
Websites and apps that do not rely on
audio alone make it easier for people

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.960
with different types of auditory
disabilities to perceive the information.

20
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.120
This includes using visual alerts
and haptic feedback,

21
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.960
such as vibration on mobile
phones, in addition to audio.

22
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.160
Another example of

23
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.480
visual alternatives to audio are captions.

24
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.440
Captions provide important audio
information in text format.

25
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.520
They indicate
who is speaking and important sounds,

26
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.880
such as significant
sound effects in a movie.

27
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.920
Many people who use captions need
to adjust the text size,

28
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.800
font, and color
to make the captions more readable.

29
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.000
While automatic captions
are gradually improving,

30
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.240
they are usually too inaccurate
to rely on as an alternative.

31
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.520
For example, they don't 
recognise specialized terms well

32
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.280
and the sentences can sometimes
run together,

33
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.600
making it hard to keep up.

34
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.480
While many people
with auditory disabilities

35
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.000
do not use sign language, for many
it is their primary language.

36
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.920
There are many sign languages in different
countries, regions, and cultures.

37
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.400
Sign language is also different
from written and spoken language.

38
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.000
That means people are often
translating between sign language

39
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.160
and written language,

40
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.320
and people’s levels of understanding
of written language can vary.

41
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.720
In order to see sign language

42
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.080
clearly, people rely on high-quality video
transmissions.

43
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.160
This includes needing access to high-speed
internet and devices

44
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.880
that can handle high-quality video.

45
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.120
People with auditory disabilities
also include people who are deaf-blind.

46
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.160
Many people who are deaf-blind
rely on communication that is tactile,

47
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.520
like braille.

48
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.480
Portable braille displays can convert text
on the computer

49
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.200
to braille letters
that can be felt on the fingertips.

50
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.840
And for multimedia, like videos, people
rely on descriptive transcripts.

51
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.640
This is text, such as an article
or script, that contains all the audio

52
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.560
and visual information so that the video
can be understood without watching it.

53
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.120
You can help make technology

54
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.280
accessible to me.

55
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.920
Accessibility: It's about people.

56
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.120
Cognitive and Learning Disabilities.

57
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.280
Cognitive and learning disabilities

58
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.880
affect how people process, understand
and remember information.

59
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.240
They cover a wide range
of cognitive differences and disabilities,

60
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.000
and many of them do not affect
overall intelligence.

61
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.400
For example, many people have varying
degrees of dyslexia.

62
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.440
Dyslexia affects the ability to recognise
and sound out written words

63
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.000
which impact
spelling and reading comprehension.

64
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.960
Websites and apps with sufficient white
space and headings to separate the content

65
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.160
make it easier for people to read.

66
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.280
Clear navigation with distinct section headers

67
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.400
also make it easier for people to navigate
through the content.

68
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.160
Websites and apps
also need to work with reading tools,

69
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.200
including tools
that adjust how the text is presented,

70
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.440
read the text aloud,
and help with spelling and grammar.

71
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.560
Similarly, some people have varying degrees
of dyscalculia.

72
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.560
Dyscalculia affects the ability to process

73
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.960
and work with numbers
in mathematical concepts.

74
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.240
Websites and apps
that provide alternatives to

75
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.920
mathematical abstractions, are easier to use
for people with dyscalculia.

76
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.280
This could include showing a progress bar
instead of or

77
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.480
in addition to showing a percentage.

78
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.280
Websites
and apps can also provide visual aids

79
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.400
and text descriptions for things
like schedules and temperatures.

80
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.840
People have varying degrees of memory

81
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.880
abilities,
including short-term and working memory.

82
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.160
Reduced short-term memory effects,
the ability to remember new things

83
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.440
such as passwords or where in a process
someone might be,

84
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.480
especially in stressful situations.

85
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.880
Websites and apps with clear navigation
and layout, prominent

86
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.360
and unique page titles
and distinct instructions and cues

87
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.200
can make it easier for people
to remember where they are in the content.

88
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.000
Websites and apps can also help people
remember information

89
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.360
they have previously added,
such as addresses and telephone numbers.

90
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.160
People might have different
levels of attention and focus.

91
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.000
This includes people with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,

92
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.520
brain trauma, age
related forgetfulness and dementia.

93
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.120
These cognitive differences affect
the ability to focus and to resume a task

94
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.760
after the user is distracted.

95
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.400
In addition to

96
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.480
breaking up longer passages of text
and using headings, websites and apps

97
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.440
without pop up windows and automatically
playing videos, sounds or animations

98
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.720
make it easier for people to focus
and follow the content.

99
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.080
Some people experience difficulty
orienting themselves

100
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.520
in layouts and visual designs
that are new to them.

101
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.680
It may also be difficult for them

102
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.760
to learn new keystrokes or gestures
needed for interaction.

103
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.640
Websites and apps with consistent
and predictable designs

104
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.920
and with clear and distinct instructions
make it easier

105
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.640
for people to know where they are
and complete tasks.

106
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.160
You can help make technology accessible.

107
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.560
To me.

108
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.240
Accessibility.

109
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.080
It's about people.

110
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.360
Physical Disabilities.

111
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.760
Physical disabilities affect how people move,

112
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.440
including an inability to move,

113
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.200
limited mobility,

114
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.760
a lack of coordination,

115
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.800
tremors and involuntary movement,

116
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.800
pain that impedes movement,

117
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.800
as well as missing and non-typical limbs.

118
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.400
People who use a mouse might
have difficulty with fine motor control.

119
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.600
For example, tremors, non-typical joints,
pain, or fatigue can prevent people

120
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.920
from being able to select small targets,
such as small links, buttons and controls.

121
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.600
Websites and apps with large clickable
areas around checkboxes, radio buttons,

122
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.240
and other controls, are easier to use
for people with limited mobility

123
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.880
and reduced dexterity.

124
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.960
Other people use speech input instead.

125
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.840
While speech input uses the
keyboard interface in the background,

126
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.040
websites and apps that are programmed and
designed with consideration for speech input

127
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.400
are more effective.

128
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.320
For example, when the name of a button in
the code matches the name displayed visually,

129
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.160
people using speech input
know what they need to say

130
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.280
to click that button.

131
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.200
Click send email.

132
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.680
Some people do not use a mouse,
touch screen, or other pointing devices.

133
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.760
They might use specialised
keyboards with larger keys,

134
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.560
or more space between the keys.

135
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.880
Some use tools such as a 
mouthstick or headstick to type.

136
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.200
Websites and apps that make functions

137
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.280
visibly clear with active focus styles

138
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.240
and usable with keyboard only

139
00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.360
are easier to use for

140
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.080
people with physical disabilities.

141
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.600
Regardless of the input device used,

142
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.440
websites and apps that provide sufficient
time to type and to complete tasks

143
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.200
are easier to use for people
with physical disabilities

144
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.800
because it might take people longer
to navigate and type,

145
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.880
and to correct typing mistakes.

146
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.960
Providing clear headings and instructions

147
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.960
helps people to understand the tasks

148
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.960
and reduces the time
needed to complete them.

149
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.200
This includes instructions for
forms and functionality,

150
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.160
as well as error messages and dialogues.

151
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.200
Finally, websites and apps that work in

152
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.520
both portrait and landscape orientation

153
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.960
are easier to use for people

154
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.600
who have their devices mounted to their

155
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.680
wheelchair, desk, or bed.

156
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.920
You can help make technology
accessible to me.

157
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.320
Accessibility: it's about people.

158
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.080
Speech Disabilities.

159
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.040
Speech disabilities

160
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.760
affect how people speak,

161
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.280
including not speaking,

162
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.720
or speaking in a range of different

163
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.960
patterns, pitches and sounds.

164
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.320
Some people do not speak at all.

165
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800
This can include people

166
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.680
who are Deaf,

167
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.520
autistic, have injured or no vocal organs,

168
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.000
or have other conditions

169
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.080
impacting physical

170
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.960
or cognitive speech production.

171
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.320
Unfortunately,

172
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.240
although it's a common misperception,

173
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.080
speaking differently

174
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.720
is not an indication of a person's

175
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.800
intellectual capabilities.

176
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.040
Many people stutter, pause,

177
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.880
or pronounce words

178
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.680
in a range of different

179
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.800
patterns, pitches and utterances

180
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.960
due to various disabilities.

181
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.000
While you might be able to understand me,

182
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.080
automatic speech recognition systems

183
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.160
often don't.

184
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.600
Some people use a variety of different

185
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.760
assistive technologies

186
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.120
to generate speech.

187
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.840
to generate speech.

188
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.240
I use software for generating speech,

189
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.320
which is often

190
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.360
not recognized

191
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.880
by automatic speech recognition.

192
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.520
Websites and apps

193
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.840
that require speech input

194
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.120
can be a barrier for people

195
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.680
with speech disabilities,

196
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.920
especially when they rely on

197
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.200
automatic speech recognition.

198
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.280
Instead,

199
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.960
 websites and apps such as customer

200
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.120
support systems

201
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.520
need to provide alternatives

202
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.360
to voice calls, like chat or email.

203
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.720
You can help make

204
00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.480
technology accessible to me.

205
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.120
Accessibility: It's about people.

206
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.320
Visual Disabilities.

207
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.120
Visual disabilities affect how people see,

208
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.360
including partial vision
in one or both eyes, not seeing at all,

209
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.680
or seeing in a range of different ways
including colors and brightness.

210
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.080
People
who are blind use assistive technology

211
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.840
on computers and mobile phones
called screen readers.

212
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.840
These software tools
can read the information

213
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.680
on the screen out loud,
or they can present it in Braille.

214
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.320
Screen readers can process websites
and apps with correctly coded headings,

215
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.400
lists, links, buttons,
and other structures much better.

216
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.360
Bird migration is the regular seasonal movement, 
often north and south along a flyway,

217
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.480
between breeding and wintering grounds.

218
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.360
Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs.

219
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.200
(A map of the world, showing some example bird migration routes image)

220
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.120
Websites and apps

221
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.920
also need to work with a keyboard
and have text alternatives for images.

222
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.600
However,
most people with visual disabilities

223
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.080
are not blind
but have some form of low vision.

224
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.840
This means that people can partially see,

225
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.120
just not clearly,
or within the full range of vision.

226
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.200
Some people with low vision
use screen magnification software

227
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.680
as a digital magnifying glass
to enlarge everything on the screen.

228
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.480
This includes images, text
and the mouse pointer.

229
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.760
With this, people only see small
parts of the screen at a time,

230
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.280
so they rely on visual cues
and consistent design in websites

231
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.320
and apps to stay oriented
and navigate effectively.

232
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.400
Others with low

233
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.960
vision might not use
the same assistive technology.

234
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.760
They might adjust properties in the web,
browser or operating system,

235
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.440
such as increasing the default text size
to better see the text.

236
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.640
Websites and apps that are programed
and designed to adapt to the properties

237
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.080
set by the users, such as different text
sizes, font type and line spacing.

238
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.400
Allow people to use the content without
the text overlapping, getting cropped

239
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.560
or requiring them to scroll
both vertically and horizontally.

240
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.880
People who cannot distinguish certain
colors are often called “color blind”.

241
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.160
Websites and apps that avoid

242
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.640
text with low contrast,

243
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.160
are easier to use.

244
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.120
It’s also important that websites and apps
don’t use only color

245
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.720
to communicate information,
but do use text and symbols in addition

246
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.720
to color, such as an asterisk
to indicate required input fields.

247
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.560
Some people are sensitive to bright light,

248
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.240
so it's important that websites and apps
can adapt to the color schemes

249
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.960
that people set in their browsers
and operating systems.

250
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.680
You can make technology accessible to me.

251
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.120
Accessibility: It's about people.

252
