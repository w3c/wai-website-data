Hi, I'm Stefan.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.320
I have dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.000
ADHD.

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.920
I have difficulty recognizing
or sounding out written words,

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.760
even though I use those same words
in conversation all the time.

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.400
It affects my spelling
and my reading comprehension.

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.680
It often takes me a long time to figure
out the individual words I'm reading,

11
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.120
and then it's hard for me to remember 

12
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.480
how the words in a sentence
fit together in a meaningful way.

13
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.440
Digital books and documents
are often much better for me.

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.600
On the computer, on a tablet,
or - my favorite - on my new e-reader.

15
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.680
I can change the font type,
text size and line spacing,

16
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.280
which makes it easier for me to read.

17
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.720
I also use the read aloud function
because I read better

18
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.640
when I can see
and hear the text at the same time.

19
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.200
It also
highlights the words being read aloud

20
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.280
and has a reading ruler,
so that I can follow along more easily.

21
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.520
Sometimes, though, digital books and
documents don't work well.

22
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.080
Sometimes they are just scanned images.

23
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.880
These also can't be read aloud
and I can't change the text size and font.

24
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.600
Some don't have bookmarks, which I use
to jump to the parts I want to focus on.

25
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.520
Or, there are long chunks of text
without any headings,

26
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.640
so I have difficulty
focusing on the content.

27
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.760
It's so much easier
when text has more spacing

28
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.120
and graphics
to make them easier to follow.

29
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.600
Another problem is when I have to do
online research,

30
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.760
I type in words, but sometimes
I do it wrong or use a different word

31
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.120
that sounds the same, like “brake”
when I mean “break”.

32
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.360
Sometimes I land on websites
with all these ads and things

33
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.520
popping up and moving around the screen.

34
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.880
With ADHD, I get distracted
by these ads and videos,

35
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.000
and sometimes I click on them
and I forget what I was meant to be doing.

36
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.680
I use several pop-up blockers,
but they don't always work.

37
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.960
When I find an article I want to read,

38
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.040
I try to remember to switch
to reading mode in my browser.

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.000
This usually removes all the stuff around
the page and lets me focus on the text.

40
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.480
But some websites don't work
well and the ads still appear,

41
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.760
or the text is too difficult
for me to read.

42
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.840
I love it when websites work well
with my settings and extensions.

43
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.560
Like, the extension
for spelling and grammar,

44
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.560
which helps me when I'm typing
things like emails.

45
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.960
That's very important for me.

46
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.000
You can help make
technology accessible to me.

47
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.560
Accessibility: It’s about people.

48
