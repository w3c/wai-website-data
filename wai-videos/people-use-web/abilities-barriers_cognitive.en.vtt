How People
with Disabilities use Digital Technology.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.560
Cognitive and Learning Disabilities.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.600
Cognitive and learning disabilities

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.200
affect how people process, understand
and remember information.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.560
They cover a wide range
of cognitive differences and disabilities,

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.320
and many of them do not affect
overall intelligence.

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.720
For example, many people have varying
degrees of dyslexia.

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.760
Dyslexia affects the ability to recognise
and sound out written words

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.320
which impact
spelling and reading comprehension.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.280
Websites and apps with sufficient white
space and headings to separate the content

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.480
make it easier for people to read.

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.600
Clear navigation with distinct section headers

13
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.720
also make it easier for people to navigate
through the content.

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.480
Websites and apps
also need to work with reading tools,

15
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.520
including tools
that adjust how the text is presented,

16
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.760
read the text aloud,
and help with spelling and grammar.

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.880
Similarly, some people have varying degrees
of dyscalculia.

18
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.880
Dyscalculia affects the ability to process

19
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.280
and work with numbers
in mathematical concepts.

20
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.560
Websites and apps
that provide alternatives to

21
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.240
mathematical abstractions, are easier to use
for people with dyscalculia.

22
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.600
This could include showing a progress bar
instead of or

23
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.800
in addition to showing a percentage.

24
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.600
Websites
and apps can also provide visual aids

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.720
and text descriptions for things
like schedules and temperatures.

26
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.160
People have varying degrees of memory

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.200
abilities,
including short-term and working memory.

28
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.480
Reduced short-term memory effects,
the ability to remember new things

29
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.760
such as passwords or where in a process
someone might be,

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.800
especially in stressful situations.

31
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.200
Websites and apps with clear navigation
and layout, prominent

32
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.680
and unique page titles
and distinct instructions and cues

33
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.520
can make it easier for people
to remember where they are in the content.

34
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.320
Websites and apps can also help people
remember information

35
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.680
they have previously added,
such as addresses and telephone numbers.

36
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.480
People might have different
levels of attention and focus.

37
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.320
This includes people with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,

38
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.840
brain trauma, age
related forgetfulness and dementia.

39
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.440
These cognitive differences affect
the ability to focus and to resume a task

40
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.080
after the user is distracted.

41
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.720
In addition to

42
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.800
breaking up longer passages of text
and using headings, websites and apps

43
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.760
without pop up windows and automatically
playing videos, sounds or animations

44
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.040
make it easier for people to focus
and follow the content.

45
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.400
Some people experience difficulty
orienting themselves

46
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.840
in layouts and visual designs
that are new to them.

47
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.000
It may also be difficult for them

48
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.080
to learn new keystrokes or gestures
needed for interaction.

49
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.960
Websites and apps with consistent
and predictable designs

50
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.240
and with clear and distinct instructions
make it easier

51
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.960
for people to know where they are
and complete tasks.

52
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.480
You can help make technology accessible.

53
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.880
To me.

54
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.560
Accessibility.

55
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.400
It's about people.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.760
