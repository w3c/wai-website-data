Elias - retiree with low vision, hand
tremor, and mild short-term memory loss.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.840
Hello! I’m Elias.

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.640
I’m a retired architect.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.680
Life moves slower now that I’m retired,

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.120
and I think my body does too [laughs]!

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.040
I see less

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.200
and hear less than in my younger days.

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.640
Also, my hands shake a little.

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
My children live far away,
so we see each other online instead.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.920
We also write to each other
and send pictures.

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.200
It’s so much easier and quicker
than going to the post office

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.640
every time

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.680
[chuckles].

15
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.280
My trouble is all this small text!
Why do they write so small?

16
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.640
I know how to make the text size bigger
but it doesn’t work with all websites.

17
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.320
Sometimes everything seems to break down
– the text

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.720
overlaps or goes somewhere else
or disappears completely.

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.400
Or, I have to scroll sideways to read –
I don’t have the time and energy for that.

20
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.520
It’s the same with apps.
I made the text bigger on my mobile phone.

21
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.280
I can’t see without doing that
on such a small screen.

22
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.360
Most apps work
well but not the banking app.

23
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.360
The text on that app is still small,

24
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.400
and I need to use it
to log into my bank account.

25
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.920
I already called them

26
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.200
several times about this
but nothing happens.

27
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.960
It’s not only reading, though.

28
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.800
When the text is small,
all the buttons and links are also small.

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.720
Sometimes tiny. Especially on forms,

30
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.440
where you have to click and select
all these things -

31
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.920
it’s hard with my hands,

32
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.600
they don’t behave like they used to.

33
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.040
Our grocery store
now has an online shop, which is fantastic

34
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.160
because I don’t have to carry
all the shopping any more.

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.880
The text is big
and it has big links and buttons.

36
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.080
It just seems clearer
and easier to find things – 

37
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.040
everything is where it should be on
every page.

38
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.800
Usually,
I have trouble remembering things,

39
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.000
like the telephone number,
address, and credit card details.

40
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.760
This store remembers from before,
so I only need to select the right address

41
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.600
in the text field
rather than needing to type it each time.

42
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.640
I wish all websites could be that easy.

43
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.480
You can help make technology
accessible to me.

44
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.320
Accessibility: It's about people.

45
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.440
