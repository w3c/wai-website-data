00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.160
How People with Disabilities Use Digital Technology.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.440
Presentation: distinguishing

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.160
and understanding.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.080
When content is accessible,

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.720
people can adjust its presentation to make it easier

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.520
to distinguish and understand.

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.960
This could include adjusting

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.160
screen size and color

9
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.280
to see better,

10
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.560
adjusting audio volume

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.360
to hear better, or adjusting

12
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.440
how text is presented to read it better.

13
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.480
Some people with low vision

14
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.560
increased the text size

15
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.320
to make it easier to read.

16
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.520
They might adjust properties

17
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.720
in the web browser or operating system,

18
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.680
such as increasing

19
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.920
the default text size,

20
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.040
font type, and line

21
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.040
spacing to better see the text.

22
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.480
Websites and apps that are programmed

23
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.480
and designed to adapt to these properties,

24
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.240
allow people to use the content

25
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.840
without the text overlapping,

26
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.920
getting cropped,

27
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.280
or requiring them to scroll

28
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.000
both vertically and horizontally.

29
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.880
Other people with low vision

30
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.520
increase everything on the screen,

31
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.080
not only text.

32
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.440
They might use screen magnification software

33
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.600
as a digital magnifying glass.

34
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.400
Some might also change the text

35
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
and background colors

36
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.880
to better read the text

37
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.160
and text-to-speech

38
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.960
to hear the text while they're reading.

39
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.480
This means that websites and apps

40
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.040
need to be programmed and designed

41
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.200
to allow people to change the colors

42
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.360
rather than forcing them

43
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.520
to appear in a certain way.

44
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.000
Presentation is not only visual.

45
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.560
People with auditory disabilities, for example,

46
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.560
might need to increase

47
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.080
the volume of online meetings

48
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.840
and multimedia like videos,

49
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.320
podcasts and music,

50
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.120
without increasing the volume of other

51
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.040
system sounds like notification alerts.

52
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.240
Adjusting the bass,

53
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.960
treble and balance of the sound

54
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960
can make the audio easier to hear,

55
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.280
so operating systems and media players

56
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.040
need to provide these settings.

57
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.480
Also, these settings work

58
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.000
better with high quality audio

59
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.040
that does not have background noise.

60
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.720
Presentation adjustments

61
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.200
can also make content easier

62
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.360
to focus on,

63
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.400
particularly for people

64
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.960
with different types of cognitive

65
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.560
and learning disabilities.

66
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.120
This includes “reading modes”

67
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.400
that hide less relevant parts of the content,

68
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.560
such as sidebars and front matter;

69
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.000
pop up and animation blockers

70
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.280
that help avoid distraction

71
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.400
and interruption;

72
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.000
and digital reading rules

73
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.800
that help readers

74
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.280
focus on one line at a time.

75
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.880
Some reading assistants,

76
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.920
for example, those that 

77
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.840
some people with dyslexia might use

78
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.480
adjust how the text is presented

79
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.440
to make it easier to read.

80
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.160
This includes changing the font type,

81
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.960
text size, colors

82
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.680
and the spacing between letters,

83
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.720
sentences and paragraphs.

84
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.200
Some people read better with serif-type fonts

85
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.240
and others with sensory fonts.

86
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.320
Adjusting these properties are individual

87
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.880
from one person to another,

88
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.960
which is why flexible

89
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.120
design is so important.

90
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.760
Other reading assistants

91
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.320
support comprehension.

92
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.680
Some can process a text

93
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.560
to simplify words and phrases,

94
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.200
and sometimes also simplify

95
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.880
complex sentences.

96
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.240
These tools rely on proper

97
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.240
programming and design to work.

98
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.680
You can help make technology accessible to me.

99
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.280
Accessibility: It’s about people.

100
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.720
