How People with Disabilities Use Digital Technology.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.080
Speech Disabilities.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.240
Speech disabilities

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.960
affect how people speak,

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.480
including not speaking,

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.920
or speaking in a range of different

7
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.160
patterns, pitches and sounds.

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.520
Some people do not speak at all.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This can include people

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.880
who are Deaf,

11
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.720
autistic, have injured or no vocal organs,

12
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.200
or have other conditions

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.280
impacting physical

14
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.160
or cognitive speech production.

15
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.520
Unfortunately,

16
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.440
although it's a common misperception,

17
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.280
speaking differently

18
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.920
is not an indication of a person's

19
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.000
intellectual capabilities.

20
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.240
Many people stutter, pause,

21
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.080
or pronounce words

22
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.880
in a range of different

23
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.000
patterns, pitches and utterances

24
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.160
due to various disabilities.

25
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.200
While you might be able to understand me,

26
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.280
automatic speech recognition systems

27
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.360
often don't.

28
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.800
Some people use a variety of different

29
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.960
assistive technologies

30
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.320
to generate speech.

31
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.040
to generate speech.

32
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.440
I use software for generating speech,

33
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.520
which is often

34
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.560
not recognized

35
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.080
by automatic speech recognition.

36
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.720
Websites and apps

37
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.040
that require speech input

38
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.320
can be a barrier for people

39
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.880
with speech disabilities,

40
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.120
especially when they rely on

41
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.400
automatic speech recognition.

42
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.480
Instead,

43
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.160
 websites and apps such as customer

44
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.320
support systems

45
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.720
need to provide alternatives

46
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.560
to voice calls, like chat or email.

47
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.920
You can help make

48
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.680
technology accessible to me.

49
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.320
Accessibility: It's about people.

50
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.760
