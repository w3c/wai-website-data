How People With Disabilities
Use Digital Technology

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.200
Input - Typing, Writing and Clicking

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.520
When content is accessible, people can 
use a variety of hardware and software

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.760
to enter text and activate commands.

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.080
Some people do not use keyboards

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.400
and use only pointing devices instead.

7
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.640
This could include a specialised mouse,

8
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.240
joystick, trackball,

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.800
or touch screen to click links and buttons
and to type on on-screen keyboards.

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.880
However, even when using these tools,

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.280
people might have difficulty

12
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.840
selecting small targets,

13
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.640
such as small links, buttons and controls.

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600
Websites and apps with large
clickable areas around checkboxes,

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.880
radio buttons, and other controls,

16
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.400
are easier to use for people

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.680
with limited mobility

18
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.160
and reduced dexterity.

19
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.960
Websites and apps also
need to provide support

20
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.920
for people who use the keyboard only.

21
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.640
This includes providing ways
to skip over repeated content,

22
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.080
such as headers and navigation bars, 
as well as not breaking the default

23
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.240
functionality in browsers
and operating systems.

24
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.320
For example,

25
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.160
using the Tab key to move around

26
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.800
clickable items in the content,

27
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.080
using the Enter key for selecting items,

28
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.520
and making the currently active item visible

29
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880
by showing a rectangular box around it.

30
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.240
Websites and apps that provide
word prediction and accelerators,

31
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.000
for example for search terms,

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.680
reduce the amount of typing,

33
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.080
and make them more efficient

34
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.360
for keyboard users.

35
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.440
Additionally, not everyone using
only the keyboard can see the screen;

36
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.960
for example, people who are blind.

37
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
So, in addition to
ensuring keyboard support,

38
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.200
websites and apps also need
to provide clear instructions, 

39
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.520
labels for form controls, error
messages, and status notifications,

40
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.200
so that people know what
is happening on the screen.

41
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.560
Websites and apps need to help people
find and correct mistakes in their input;

42
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.360
for example, by showing a summary
of the entered data before submitting it.

43
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.800
They also need to provide sufficient
time to complete tasks,

44
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.320
or avoid timing limitations altogether.

45
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.840
Many people with disabilities
require more time to navigate

46
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.920
and orient themselves in the
content, and to click and type.

47
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.560
In particular, people with cognitive
and learning disabilities.

48
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.760
Finally, websites and apps also need
to consider people who do not use

49
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.160
keyboard or pointing devices at all,
and use speech input instead.

50
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.760
For example, websites and apps
need to be programmed and designed

51
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.120
so that the name of a button

52
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.280
in the software code matches
the name displayed to the user.

53
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.320
Click send email.

54
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.840
You can help make technology
accessible to me.

55
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.320
Accessibility: it's about people.

56
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.360

use digital technology
