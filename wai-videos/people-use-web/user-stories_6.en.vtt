Dhruv, older adult student who is deaf.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.920
Hello! My name is D-H-R-U-V, Dhruv. I’m Deaf.

4
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:30.040
I can hear some sounds but not enough to understand speech.

5
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:40.360
I sign British Sign Language. I think and dream in signs.

6
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.480
I recently enrolled in an online degree.

7
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.480
For my classes I schedule can interpreters who interpret 

8
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.080
the lectures and conversations, and voice for me.

9
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.080
I need video conferencing apps with functionality to “pin” videos

10
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.480
of the interpreters so that I can always see them.

11
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.760
Some lectures have realtime captioning typed by human captioners.

12
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.640
This is more accurate than automatic captions, which often

13
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.440
don’t recognize specialized terms in the lectures.

14
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.840
For our assigned videos, I rely on good captions.

15
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.040
These are edited so that each sentence appearing on the screen

16
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.000
is not too long and is synchronized with the audio.

17
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.840
I also often find myself needing to adjust the text size and colors of

18
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.360
the captions, to be able to read them better. Some apps also allow

19
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.520
me to move the captions to the top or bottom of the video,

20
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880
so that they are not in the way.

21
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.520
In some situations, I find myself lip reading.

22
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.400
For example, when I’m on unplanned calls without interpreters

23
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.560
or other people who can sign.

24
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.280
I learned lip reading over the years because of such 

25
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.720
situations but it’s not always reliable for me.

26
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.840
I need to see the person’s mouth, have them speak clearly,

27
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.280
and seeing their gestures also helps. Yet it’s exhausting

28
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.680
and not really something I can keep doing for too long.

29
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.920
I also use the chat function.

30
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.200
Some chat tools support realtime text

31
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.640
rather than line-by-line text messages.

32
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.880
This is much more interactive, and I can engage with my friends in

33
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.160
 text conversations as others do by voice.

34
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.800
Of course, the classes also come with a lot of reading.

35
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.560
I’m fine with that, except when the writing is unnecessarily

36
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.080
complex and without structure like lists and headings.

37
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.240
People don’t realize that for me reading text involves extra effort,

38
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.200
because sign language is my native language.

39
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.840
So, like for everyone else, clear and simple writing makes

40
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.080
text easier to understand.

41
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.400
You can help make technology accessible to me.

42
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.280
Accessibility: It’s about people.

43
