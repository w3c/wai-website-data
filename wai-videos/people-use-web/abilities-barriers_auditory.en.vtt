Auditory Disabilities

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.720
Auditory disabilities affect how people
hear, including hearing less in one

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.000
Auditory Disabilities.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.160
or both ears,
not hearing, and hearing sounds

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.280
in a range of different ways.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.000
High-quality sound is important
for many people with reduced hearing.

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.480
Audio needs to be clear and background
noise low

9
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.800
to make speech easier to understand.

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.320
Websites and apps that allow users
to adjust the volume of the audio

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.560
that it is currently playing

12
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.640
without changing the volume for other
sounds from the computer, such

13
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.600
as notifications, make it easier
for people to hear the audio.

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.600
Some people with auditory disabilities
use hearing devices but this does

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.080
not always mean they can hear all audio,
or hear it clearly.

16
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.280
Websites and apps that do not rely on
audio alone make it easier for people

17
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.640
with different types of auditory
disabilities to perceive the information.

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.800
This includes using visual alerts
and haptic feedback,

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.640
such as vibration on mobile
phones, in addition to audio.

20
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.840
Another example of

21
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.160
visual alternatives to audio are captions.

22
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.120
Captions provide important audio
information in text format.

23
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.200
They indicate
who is speaking and important sounds,

24
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.560
such as significant
sound effects in a movie.

25
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.600
Many people who use captions need
to adjust the text size,

26
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.480
font, and color
to make the captions more readable.

27
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.680
While automatic captions
are gradually improving,

28
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.920
they are usually too inaccurate
to rely on as an alternative.

29
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.200
For example, they don't 
recognise specialized terms well

30
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.960
and the sentences can sometimes
run together,

31
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.280
making it hard to keep up.

32
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.160
While many people
with auditory disabilities

33
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.680
do not use sign language, for many
it is their primary language.

34
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.600
There are many sign languages in different
countries, regions, and cultures.

35
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.080
Sign language is also different
from written and spoken language.

36
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.680
That means people are often
translating between sign language

37
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.840
and written language,

38
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.000
and people’s levels of understanding
of written language can vary.

39
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.400
In order to see sign language

40
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.760
clearly, people rely on high-quality video
transmissions.

41
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.840
This includes needing access to high-speed
internet and devices

42
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.560
that can handle high-quality video.

43
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.800
People with auditory disabilities
also include people who are deaf-blind.

44
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.840
Many people who are deaf-blind
rely on communication that is tactile,

45
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.200
like braille.

46
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.160
Portable braille displays can convert text
on the computer

47
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.880
to braille letters
that can be felt on the fingertips.

48
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.520
And for multimedia, like videos, people
rely on descriptive transcripts.

49
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.320
This is text, such as an article
or script, that contains all the audio

50
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.240
and visual information so that the video
can be understood without watching it.

51
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.800
You can help make technology

52
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.960
accessible to me.

53
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.640
Accessibility: It's about people.
