Ade, reporter with limited use of his arms.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.440
Hello! I’m Ade,

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.120
I’m quadriplegic, which means I have limited movement

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.360
in my arms as well as my legs.

6
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.360
The techonology I use is really important to me.

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.840
I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts,

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.440
especially for the programs that I use often.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.440
For example, scrolling a page is much easier with the arrow keys on

10
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.000
the keyboard than by clicking on that button in the scroll bar.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.360
Unfortunately, many websites and apps

12
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.920
don’t work well with my keyboard.

13
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.600
Often what has focus is not clear

14
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.680
or it jumps around completely out of order.

15
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.040
Sometimes that doesn’t work well because some websites

16
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.040
and apps don’t work in landscape orientation,

17
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.360
which is how I setup my tablet so that the

18
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.040
buttons are big enough for me to click.

19
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840
While I can use a keyboard and joystick,

20
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840
I can’t use them for long periods because it’s tiring.

21
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.400
So, I recently started using speech control software as well.

22
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.560
It allows me to dictate text instead of typing,

23
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.360
and to say certain commands instead of clicking.

24
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.800
It’s really hard to learn a new way of working after so many years

25
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.880
but I’ve been patient with it and I’m slowly getting used to it.

26
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
The most difficult thing is buttons without labels.

27
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.400
It is not clear which voice commands will activate them.

28
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.440
You can help make technology accessible to me.

29
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.320
Accessibility: It’s about people.
