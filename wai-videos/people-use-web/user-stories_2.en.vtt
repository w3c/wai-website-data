Ian, data scientist with autism.

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.080
Hello! I’m Ian.

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.320
I’m autistic.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.560
I work for a software company three bus stops from my home.

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.360
I’m a data scientist. I enjoy my work very much. 

7
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.720
Others find this work difficult because it’s quite technical

8
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.840
but for me, it’s really easy.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.280
Except when something changes

10
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.520
and I don’t have enough time to figure out what changed.

11
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.760
Like, when I was trying to get to an online meeting

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.360
and found that the buttons on the app changed.

13
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.560
It was very stressful because

14
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.040
I was worried about being late to the meeting.

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.200
Apps that ask for permission before updating

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.920
allow me to find a suitable time and adjust to the changes.

17
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.360
Sometimes I press the wrong thing and everything just changes

18
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.800
and I don’t know how to go back. 

19
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.400
It makes me feel like I just can’t cope.

20
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.600
I am trying to work, but I just can’t and I start to panic,

21
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.360
and then I can’t even talk anymore.

22
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.120
It’s very important to me when I can roll back and undo changes

23
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.560
that I didn’t intend or expect to happen.

24
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.480
It’s also really frustrating when I have to stop work

25
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.920
because of an error message that doesn’t tell me what the error is.

26
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.000
Error messages that just say “input error” are so useless.

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.400
Often it’s something really simple,

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.360
like I didn’t use the right format for the date.

29
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.280
Why doesn’t it say that?

30
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.920
I love to cook when I’m not working.

31
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.280
My friends love to eat what I cook because I find the best recipes!

32
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.240
Some cooking websites and apps are easy to use.

33
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.320
My favorite recipe sites list the exact ingredients

34
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.800
and have step-by-step instructions.

35
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.360
It’s easy to find the recipes using the tags and to follow them.

36
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.040
Unfortunately, I can’t use some recipe sites

37
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
even though they have recipes I really want to try.

38
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.800
Especially the ones where all sorts of videos start playing

39
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.760
and pop-up windows appear without me pressing anything.

40
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.760
I didn’t ask for this!

41
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.360
These are overwhelming and aren’t the recipe.

42
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.360
All I want is the recipe!

43
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.600
Or some sites use meaningless words and phrases

44
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.640
and don’t even bother explaining them.

45
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.640
I mean - what is a scant cup of brown sugar?

46
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.440
”Scant” could mean so many different things.

47
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.160
Instead of “scant” just say what you mean.

48
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.560
Like a cooking cup filled just below the top

49
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.280
or not quite a full cup.

50
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.840
That would be easier to understand for everyone.

51
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.120
You can help make technology accessible to me.

52
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Accessibility: It’s about people.

53
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.160
