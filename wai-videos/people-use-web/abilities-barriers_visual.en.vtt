How People with Disabilities Use Digital Technology.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.920
Visual Disabilities.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.320
Visual disabilities affect how people see,

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.560
including partial vision
in one or both eyes, not seeing at all,

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.880
or seeing in a range of different ways
including colors and brightness.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.280
People
who are blind use assistive technology

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.040
on computers and mobile phones
called screen readers.

8
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.040
These software tools
can read the information

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.880
on the screen out loud,
or they can present it in Braille.

10
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.520
Screen readers can process websites
and apps with correctly coded headings,

11
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.600
lists, links, buttons,
and other structures much better.

12
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.560
Bird migration is the regular seasonal movement, 
often north and south along a flyway,

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.680
between breeding and wintering grounds.

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.560
Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs.

15
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.400
(A map of the world, showing some example bird migration routes image)

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.320
Websites and apps

17
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.120
also need to work with a keyboard
and have text alternatives for images.

18
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.800
However,
most people with visual disabilities

19
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.280
are not blind
but have some form of low vision.

20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.040
This means that people can partially see,

21
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.320
just not clearly,
or within the full range of vision.

22
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.400
Some people with low vision
use screen magnification software

23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.880
as a digital magnifying glass
to enlarge everything on the screen.

24
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.680
This includes images, text
and the mouse pointer.

25
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.960
With this, people only see small
parts of the screen at a time,

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.480
so they rely on visual cues
and consistent design in websites

27
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.520
and apps to stay oriented
and navigate effectively.

28
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.600
Others with low

29
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.160
vision might not use
the same assistive technology.

30
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.960
They might adjust properties in the web,
browser or operating system,

31
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.640
such as increasing the default text size
to better see the text.

32
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.840
Websites and apps that are programed
and designed to adapt to the properties

33
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
set by the users, such as different text
sizes, font type and line spacing.

34
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.600
Allow people to use the content without
the text overlapping, getting cropped

35
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.760
or requiring them to scroll
both vertically and horizontally.

36
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.080
People who cannot distinguish certain
colors are often called “color blind”.

37
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.360
Websites and apps that avoid

38
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.840
text with low contrast,

39
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.360
are easier to use.

40
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.320
It’s also important that websites and apps
don’t use only color

41
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.920
to communicate information,
but do use text and symbols in addition

42
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.920
to color, such as an asterisk
to indicate required input fields.

43
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.760
Some people are sensitive to bright light,

44
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.440
so it's important that websites and apps
can adapt to the color schemes

45
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.160
that people set in their browsers
and operating systems.

46
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.880
You can make technology accessible to me.

47
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.320
Accessibility: It's about people.
