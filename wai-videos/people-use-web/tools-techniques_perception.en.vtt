00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.080
How people with Disabilities use Digital Technology.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.200
Perception - hearing, feeling and seeing.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.640
When content is accessible,

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.680
people can perceive it through different senses,

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.120
depending on their needs and preferences.

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.080
For example,

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.680
some people who can't see a screen

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.720
or hear audio,

9
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.240
rely on websites and apps

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.440
that can present the information

11
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.920
in different ways.

12
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.280
People who are blind may

13
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.560
use assistive technology

14
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.320
on computers and mobile phones

15
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.000
called screen readers.

16
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.320
These software tools

17
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.640
read the information on the screen out loud,

18
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.880
or they can present it in braille.

19
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.720
Bird.

20
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.880
Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates

21
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.040
constituting the class Aves,

22
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.720
(/’eIvi:z/)

23
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.160
characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of

24
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.560
Screen readers process websites and apps

25
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.240
with correctly coded headings,

26
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.720
lists, links, buttons, and other structures much better.

27
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.160
People who are blind rely on hearing or touch,

28
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.760
rather than sight.

29
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.600
For video,

30
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.040
content creators need to ensure

31
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.680
that visual information is provided

32
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.040
in auditory form as well.

33
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.880
Often these descriptions

34
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.360
of visual information can be placed

35
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.400
in existing pauses in the audio,

36
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.760
or the script can be created

37
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.600
from the start with sufficient description

38
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.360
of the scenes, characters,

39
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.440
and other important visual information.

40
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.600
People who are deaf-blind

41
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.400
also use screen readers to present the information

42
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.760
using a device called a

43
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.120
Refreshable Braille display.

44
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.840
Braille characters are a combination

45
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.360
of raised or lowered dots,

46
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.200
which people read by scanning over them

47
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.840
with their fingertips.

48
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.640
Similarly to people who are blind and deaf-blind,

49
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.960
people who are Deaf or hard of hearing

50
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.240
may use haptic feedback too;

51
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.920
for example, through vibration alerts on a mobile phone

52
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.960
instead of auditory notifications.

53
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.520
People who are Deaf or hard of hearing

54
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.240
often rely on seeing instead of hearing.

55
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.080
For example, while watching a video

56
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.320
they may use captions or sign language

57
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.560
as an alternative to the audio.

58
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.480
You can help

59
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.320
make technology

60
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.320
accessible

61
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.600
to me.

62
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.400
Accessibility: It's about people.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.560
