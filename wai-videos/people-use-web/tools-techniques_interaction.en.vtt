How people with Disabilities use Digital Technology.

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.360
Interaction - navigation and finding

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.480
When content is accessible,

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.560
people can navigate and find information

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.840
using different strategies and approaches

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.360
depending on their preferences,

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.240
skills and abilities.

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.000
Many people with cognitive

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.360
and learning disabilities

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.240
rely on clear layout and design

11
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.360
to find information on websites and apps.

12
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.480
This includes different ways

13
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.040
of navigating the content,

14
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920
such as using hierarchical menus

15
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.840
as well as search functionality;

16
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.360
with visual orientation cues,

17
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.920
such as using background colors

18
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.160
to indicate different parts

19
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.200
of the content,

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.720
using unique headings,

21
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.160
and placing relevant information

22
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.040
in prominent areas.

23
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.440
It's also important to use

24
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.680
a consistent and predictable design.

25
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.960
While many of these are typically usability

26
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.680
aspects that affect people with

27
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.320
and without disabilities,

28
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.560
these situations often

29
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.760
affect people with disabilities to a greater extent.

30
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.640
For example,

31
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.640
people with low vision

32
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.240
who use screen magnification

33
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.880
also rely on visual orientation cues

34
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.200
to orient themselves and find information

35
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
on websites and apps.

36
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.640
And consistency predictability helps everyone.

37
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.320
For example,

38
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.160
people who are blind use screen readers

39
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.880
to scan the content structures,

40
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.960
such as headings,

41
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.840
links, and navigational menus

42
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.440
to get an overview and orient themselves.

43
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.000
Websites and apps with clear

44
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.360
and consistent headings,

45
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120
labels and structures

46
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.880
make the content

47
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.280
more predictable and easier to navigate.

48
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.120
In addition,

49
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.120
people who are blind rely on mechanisms

50
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.040
to skip over blocks of content,

51
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.120
such as headings,

52
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.160
navigation bars,

53
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.080
or menus,

54
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.600
repeated within websites and apps.

55
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.920
They also rely on websites and apps to provide

56
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.120
clear instructions

57
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.600
and help users identify

58
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.920
and correct mistakes,

59
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.280
such as incorrect dates,

60
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.440
numbers and other input.

61
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.480
In addition,

62
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.120
people with physical disabilities

63
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.520
rely on consistent labels which allow browsers

64
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.400
to optionally remember previous entries.

65
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.720
This speeds up typing

66
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.880
because people can select previous entries,

67
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.560
for example, names and addresses.

68
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.000
You can help make technology
accessible to me.

69
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.080
Accessibility: it's about people.
