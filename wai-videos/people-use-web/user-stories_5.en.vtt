Sophie,

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.520
basketball fan with Down syndrome.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.080
Hello, I'm Sophie.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.880
I have Down syndrome.

6
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.320
I love basketball!

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.080
And I played on my school team,

8
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.800
and now I work in a stadium.

9
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.280
At work, we use an app for our team.

10
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.240
It has a calendar

11
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.920
with all our practices and games.

12
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.480
My job is to record scores and stuff like that.

13
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.000
I can also use it to chat with the coach

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.720
and with the players,

15
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.960
and we use it to exchange photos and jokes too.

16
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.640
[chuckles]

17
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.600
Sometimes, I take longer to read things

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.680
but this app is really easy to use.

19
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.680
The event or name of the player is at the top,

20
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.320
so I know where I am in the app.

21
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.320
The calendar is also very clear.

22
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.040
It shows the name of the month

23
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.880
or the number of the week at the top too.

24
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.680
Other apps we tried are too confusing -

25
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.320
I could never tell where I am and how to get back.

26
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.680
The biggest problem is buying tickets for games.

27
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.880
I try to use this app for buying

28
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.200
but sometimes

29
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.040
I have to use other apps to get tickets.

30
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.600
Some of these apps are too hard.

31
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.000
When I click on something

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.280
it goes somewhere else

33
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.200
or opens another page.

34
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.360
Or, it doesn't have that blue box at the top

35
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240
so I don't know where I am

36
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.400
and how to get back.

37
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.520
Sometimes it takes too long,

38
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.360
I have to start all over again.

39
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.560
It's a real pain.

40
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.040
I wish buying tickets could be easier.

41
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.240
My dream is to become a senior assistant.

42
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.240
I know I can do it.

43
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.240
Sometimes it's hard

44
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.680
for me to write long things,

45
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.440
but I use the spell-checker every time.

46
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.760
It helps me when coaches use

47
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.680
words I already know.

48
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.400
Otherwise, it takes me even

49
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.480
longer to find the words

50
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.560
in the dictionary.

51
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.160
You can help make technology accessible to me.

52
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.760
Accessibility: It’s about people.

53
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.320
